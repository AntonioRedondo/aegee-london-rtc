# Brexit - What Next?

[_Brexit - What Next?_](https://www.facebook.com/events/119654038754683) is a 6-day event organised by [AEGEE-London](https://www.facebook.com/AegeeLondon), [AEGEE-Manchester](https://www.facebook.com/AEGEE.Manchester) and [AEGEE-Sheffield](https://www.facebook.com/AEGEESheffield) from November 29th until December 4th 2017 in Sheffield and Manchester, United Kingdom.

The event brought together British students and young people from all across Europe to debate on the topic of Brexit. The workshops and panel discussions, held by notable speakers and experts, helped to deepen the understanding of participants on the issue, as well as brainstorm on the possible consequences and solutions.

[AEGEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEGEE) stands for Association des États Généraux des Étudiants de l'Europe and it is known as European Students' Forum in English. It is the largest trans-national, interdisciplinary student organisation in Europe. Established in 1985, AEGEE currently has around 13,000 members and almost 200 local branches (antennae) in university cities across Europe, including Russia, Turkey and the Caucasus, with a European board and head office in Brussels.

AEGEE strives for a democratic, diverse and borderless Europe, which is socially, economically and politically integrated, and values the participation of young people in its construction and development. AEGEE is a secular, non-profit organization, not linked to any political party. All projects and activities are based on voluntarily work of its members. AEGEE empowers students and young people in Europe to take an active role in society by influencing political decision makers, and it creates a space for dialogue and learning opportunities.
